# I3D models trained on Kinetics

## Overview

This repository contains trained models reported in the paper "[Quo Vadis,
Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics
Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07750)" by Joao Carreira and Andrew
Zisserman.

This code is based on Deepmind's [Kinetics-I3D](https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d). Including PyTorch versions of their models.


# Fine-tuning and Feature Extraction
We provide code to extract I3D features and fine-tune I3D for charades. Our fine-tuned models on charades are also available in the models director (in addition to Deepmind's trained models).
